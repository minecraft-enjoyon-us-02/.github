# Plot Overview
---
The movie follows **Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison** (played by **Jason Momoa**), a seemingly ordinary guy with a not-so-ordinary destiny. Garrett, along with three unlikely companions—**Henry** (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), **Natalie** (Emma Myers), and **Dawn** (Danielle Brooks)—gets mysteriously transported into the *Minecraft* Overworld through a strange portal.

Once inside this pixelated realm, they must adapt quickly. Blocks, crafting tables, mobs, and magic become their new reality. As the group scrambles to find a way back home, they meet **Steve** (played by **Jack Black**), a quirky and seasoned Minecraft adventurer.

Together, they embark on a wild quest to stop a growing threat—hostile creatures like **Piglins** and **Zombies** that are beginning to overrun the world. As they learn to build, craft, and survive, the characters also grow closer, learning about bravery, teamwork, and what it means to be a hero—even in a world made of cubes.
